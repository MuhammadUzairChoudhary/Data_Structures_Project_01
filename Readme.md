## System Overview

The system is built using C++ and provides various scenarios for analyzing employee data. It reads employee data from a file named "Employeedata.txt" and stores it in an array of structures. It offers five main scenarios for data analysis:

## Scenario #1: Employee Data Analysis

- Calculate the average salary of all employees.
- Count and display the total number of employees.
- Calculate the average tenure of employees.
- Display the number of employees for each designation.
- Find the employee with the longest tenure.

## Scenario #2: Salary Analysis

- Find the employee with the highest salary.
- Find the employee with the lowest salary.
- Calculate the salary range (the difference between the highest and lowest salary).
- Calculate the median salary.
- Calculate the average salary for each designation.

## Scenario #3: Tenure Analysis

- Find the employee with the longest tenure.
- Find the employee with the shortest tenure.
- Calculate the average tenure for each designation.
- Find the designation with the highest average salary.

## Scenario #4: Salary Ranking

- Rank employees based on their salaries in ascending order using Bubble Sort.
- Display the sorted list of employees and the time taken for sorting.

## Scenario #5: Tenure Ranking

- Rank employees based on their tenure in ascending order using Bubble Sort.
- Display the sorted list of employees and the time taken for sorting.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program with a C++ compiler.

2. Make sure you have a file named "Employeedata.txt" containing employee data in the same directory as the executable.

3. Run the program.

4. The main menu will be displayed, and you can choose one of the scenarios by entering the corresponding scenario number (1-5).

5. Follow the prompts and view the results of the selected scenario.

6. To exit the program, choose option 6 from the main menu.

This system allows you to analyze employee data efficiently, providing valuable insights into salaries, tenures, and other aspects of your workforce.
